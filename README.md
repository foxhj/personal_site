# Personal Portfolio Site

This is the repo for my personal portfolio page. I'm working on this project to teach myself the fundamentals of full stack development. Currently, the site only consists of a few simple static pages, links to my socials and a contact form to get in touch with me. Currently working on an app that renders articles ive written about some of my projects from a Postgres instance via docker.
